## Declares and puts 'default' in whitelist value if not present in stream definition.
## This whitelist value is later combined with the syslog_path and some other strings
## and gives something similar: /etc/syslog-ng/whitelists/f_whitelist_stream-name.txt
## The combination with the other variable and string happens later because this dict
## value needs to stay intact, as one of the first steps before deploying the whitelist
## is to check if declared whitelist exists on localhost, therefore we cannot have a
## path starting with '/etc/syslog-ng/' which essentially represents the target path.
## The whitelist 'f_whitelist_default.txt' is file present on localhost that essentially
## blacklist all incoming logs as it is empty.
## This step is not really needed, but it mgiht be usefull to debug if needed and also
## avoids doing extra actions later in syslog-ng_config.yml.
